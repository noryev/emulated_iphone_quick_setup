# emulated_iphone_quick_setup
quickly setup a iphone vm for many use cases such as secured social media and much more

what can you emulate iphone OS's on? 

  maybe writing a script to open a Xcode instance and hosting the app on it. 
  
      RAM would be needed if you wanted to host multiple instances of Xcode
